# Big_Integer_Project
In C/C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a maximum of 20. But if we need to store an even bigger number, say a 22 digit number, then it is not easy to store it in any kind of primitive type. So to deal with this type of problem, we are going to design a new data type which is going to be called "BigInt" in this project.
